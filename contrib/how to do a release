putting this here because i'll forget how to do it otherwise

update the pyproject.toml
tag it in git, eg v1.0

## build the builds

WHEEL + SOURCE TARBALL
python3 -m build

ZIP BUNDLE
contrib/bundle.sh

and then put ALL items from `dist` into the pip index dir - ~/site2/yt-dlp-rajiko/pip/yt-dlp-rajiko/
because without the .whl pip has to "build" it itself, with all the stuff that needs to be installed for that to work

run script to update the pip index html and the dl/ "latest" symlinks
this also updates the sha256 blocks on the site

## update the changelog file

write in html, paste into the feed xml like <![CDATA[
stuff
]]>
make sure to set the link, date
to get date use:
git log --pretty --date=rfc2822

include the pip instructions, sha256sum etc

now push to the server

NOW UPLOAD TO PYPI AS WELL

go to dl/ dir and do like
twine upload yt_dlp_rajiko-1.x-py3-none-any.whl yt_dlp_rajiko-1.x.tar.gz


## update github

paste the changelog output into a github release, upload the new builds
change link at the bottom to just "below"

post in the radiko thread on 5ch if i can be bothered

and thats probably all
