putting this here because i'll forget how to do it otherwise

update the pyproject.toml
tag it in git, eg v1.0

## build the builds
python3 -m build

and then put BOTH items from `dist` into the pip index dir - ~/site2/yt-dlp-rajiko/pip/yt-dlp-rajiko/
because without the .whl pip has to "build" it itself, with all the stuff that needs to be installed for that to work
update the pip index html

## update the changelog file

~/site2/yt-dlp-rajiko/CHANGELOG

```
version number
date (git log v1.0 --pretty --date=rfc2822)
url: whl download link
sha256: sha256 of the whl
brief summary of the release
can span multiple lines

bullet points of changes, 1 per line
simple present tense, third person singular - continue "this release...", eg..
fixes a bug where the computer would explode
makes downloading 5000x faster
```

./generate_changelog.py to make the new rss feed

## update the website

move the previous release into the "Previous releases" <details>
update the sha256 (just sha256 command in the pip dir)
update the whl link
repeat for japanese version

now push to the server

## update github

paste the changelog output into a github release, upload the new builds

and thats probably all
