putting this here because i'll forget how to do it otherwise

update the pyproject.toml
tag it in git, eg v1.0

## build the builds
python3 -m build

and then put BOTH items from `dist` into the pip index dir - ~/site2/yt-dlp-rajiko/pip/yt-dlp-rajiko/
because without the .whl pip has to "build" it itself, with all the stuff that needs to be installed for that to work

run script to update the pip index html and the dl/ "latest" symlinks

## update the changelog file

not bothering with the script any more, i just want to spout

write in html, paste into the feed xml like <![CDATA[
stuff
]]>
make sure to set the link, date
(git log --pretty --date=rfc2822)
include the pip instructions, sha256sum etc

## update the website

!!!!!!!!!!!
move the previous release into the "Previous releases" <details>
update the sha256 (just sha256 command in the pip dir)
!!!!!!!!!!!
(forgot last time)

update the whl link
repeat for japanese version

now push to the server

## update github

paste the changelog output into a github release, upload the new builds

and thats probably all
