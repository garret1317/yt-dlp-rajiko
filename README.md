# yt-dlp-rajiko

improved [radiko.jp](https://radiko.jp) extractor plugin for yt-dlp (fast and areafree)

<p>yt-dlp-rajiko lets you download Japanese radio shows from <a href="https://radiko.jp">radiko.jp</a> without a VPN, using <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>.
It downloads quickly, and works for any participating station*, from anywhere in the world.<br>
<small>*except NHK, but they have <a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/radio/">their own site</a> which is supported
in yt-dlp proper</small></p>


<p>Intended for personal archiving, not for commercial use. Please subscribe to radiko Premium if you are able.<br>
<small>(It's Free Software, so this is just me asking nicely, not a hard requirement. but you should do it so that radiko can keep existing)<br>
(also, if you get the timefree30 plan you can use it with yt-dlp :P)
</small></p>
